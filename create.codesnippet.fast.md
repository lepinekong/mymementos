# Create Code Snippet fast for Visual Studio Code


### Step 1: Install **Easy Snippet** Extension


Search "Easy Snippet" by clicking the extension icons inside VSCode 
or install from this [link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=inu1255.easy-snippet)


### Step 2: Convert selected code to snippet


Write your code template and select it (don't bother to create placeholder variables yet, it won't take it into account very well.)

### Step 4: Check that your code snippet works

Go back to code editor, and type Ctrl+Space to list all code snippets and then your snippet (the one with black square icon)
