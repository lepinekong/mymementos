### What is Jupyter Notebook ?

Jupyter Notebook integrates code and its output into a single document that combines visualizations, narrative text, mathematical equations, and other rich media. 

The Jupyter project is the successor to the earlier IPython Notebook, which was first published as a prototype in 2010. 

### Install Anaconda

The easiest way for a beginner to get started with Jupyter Notebooks is by installing Anaconda. Anaconda is the most widely used Python distribution for data science and comes pre-loaded with all the most popular libraries and tools.
